We'll discuss DOM elements in detail later. By now we'd just say that a DOM element is actually any tag on the page. This has nothing to do with a tag's purpose or the BEM specification.\nJust remember that a BEM element is a logical concept, while a DOM element is a technical one.","web_theme1.4_lesson6_separated_by_a_hyphen":"This is called kebab case. Hyphens form some sort of skewer that holds letters like pieces of meat (or veggies, as you prefer it).","web_theme7.2_lesson5_ES6":"ES6 is the sixth version of the ECMAScript specification introduced in 2015. That's why it's sometimes called ES2015.","web_theme4.2_lesson1_task1_Math":"`Math` is one of the standard built-in objects of JavaScript.

We'll talk more about this later.","web_theme8.3_lesson3_visual representation":"When a class has a visual representation, it means it has certain properties and methods that are responsible for visualization and interactivity. Do you remember the `_getTemplate()` and `_setEventListeners()` methods of the `Card` class? These methods interact with markup and event listeners. That's why when speaking of the `Card` class, we say it has a visual representation.","web_theme8.3_lesson3_Validation API":"The validity object along with all its properties and methods.","web_theme8.5_lesson6_module.exports":"This is the first time we've worked with Node.js. In it, the `module` global object is available by default. Its `exports` property indicates what must be exported from a file.

In all other files, we'll continue using the good old `import` and `export` directives.","web_theme8.5_lesson6_require()":"The `require()` function is the Node.js analog of `import`.

In all other files, we'll continue using the `import` directive.","web_theme8.5_lesson6___dirname":"The `__dirname` variable in Node.js is available globally. It contains the absolute path to the folder, which stores the file where we used this variable.

In short, if you don't pass the `importLoaders` option, PostCSS won't process CSS files that have `@import`.

It's often used to test how a site behaves on low bandwidth.","web_theme9.5_lesson1_v1":"Most APIs evolve over time. In the future, we may somehow modify the project API. For example, we may change the structure of a request. But one doesn't simply make such modifications as changing requests can cause issues with the functionality that depends on that request.\n\nTo prevent this, engineers have agreed to specify the API version by writing it in the API address. `v1` means the first version of the API. When something is modified or changed in an API, the version can change to v2, and be updated along these lines as new changes continue to come along. However, your code's server requests will continue functioning as before, as they have their version explicitly indicated and will know to use the first version of the API.

Inside this method's callback, we describe transformations that will be applied to each element of the array.","web_react_props":"Shorthand for \"properties\".","web_theme10.2_lesson8_React_engine":"By the way, sometimes when we talk about React, we'll use the term \"engine\" whenever we're speaking about the internal processes of the actual React.js library. At the same time, we also use the term React when describing the general principles, approaches, and development methodologies that are built around this library.","web_theme10.3_lesson2_optimized_build":"The code that we use in the production version of our application can be quite different. For example, there are a number of engineering tools that we use in our project that won't need to be included in the final code. Additionally, our code can be minified, compressed, and assembled to ensure better overall performance.","web_react_presentational_components":"These React components are only responsible for rendering data in the\nbrowser, meaning that they are primarily concerned with the visual look\nof the application. They are usually supplemented with container\ncomponents that are responsible for loading and processing data.","web_js_assets":"In terms of web design and development, this term typically refers to the text content, pictures, graphics, video and audio files, and databases.","web_theme10.5_lesson2_prompt":"The `prompt()` function, much like the `alert()` function, will show users a dialog box containing whatever message we pass to the function. In addition, `prompt()` also allows you to receive some data back from the user, which will be returned by the function, so we can use it in our code. This data will be a string, so if we need to change it to a number type, we can pass the value from `prompt()` to the `Number()` function.\n\nIn real projects, engineers really don't make much use of `prompt()`. We're only bringing it up for educational purposes.","web_theme9.5_lesson1_dist":"If you have a build folder with a different name in your project, replace `dist` with this name.","web_js_options_object":"This is a normal JavaScript object that contains a set of named parameters that are passed into a function.
